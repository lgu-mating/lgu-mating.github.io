# About

This website is made for fun. There are many anecdotes in LGU saying that people are making love everywhere: 
Classrooms, silent cells and even sides of the lake. So, let us just collect a list of these places.

We do think it is perfect to express our love bravely or even wildly. However, many of the places are considered public and your behaviours may have some negative consequences on others.

It is also our duty and reponsibility to consider others' feelings and to work together constructing a wonderful campus environment for all the students. 

Hope that everyone can enjoy a wonderful time with his or her beloved ones.

> Love and Aphrodite are inseparable and Aphrodite is actually two goddesses, for which reason there are two kinds of Love. One is Urania, known as Heavenly Aphrodite, and the younger is Pandemos, known as Common Aphrodite, so accordingly there exists Heavenly Love and Common Love. They are both to be praised, as all gods and actions are, but praise depends on how the actions are performed; the praise and nobility of Love depends on the sentiments he produces in us. (The Speech of Pausanias)
